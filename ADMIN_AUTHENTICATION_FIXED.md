# Admin Authentication Fixed ✅

## Problem Identified
The admin dashboard was showing "Admin not found" errors because:
1. The admin user existed in Supabase Auth but was missing from the `profiles` table
2. The admin user was missing from the `clients` table
3. The admin authentication system couldn't find the admin profile

## Root Cause
- Admin user was created in Supabase Auth but the corresponding profile record was never created
- The admin login API was looking for the user in the `profiles` table but couldn't find it
- This caused authentication failures for all admin APIs

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Admin Profile
- Found existing admin user in Supabase Auth (ID: `51d1c5d6-3137-4d0c-b0b3-73deb56a9fa1`)
- Created missing profile record in `profiles` table with `superadmin` role
- Set proper admin user details (name, email, role, etc.)

### 2. Created Admin Client Record
- Created corresponding client record in `clients` table
- Linked to admin user and profile
- Set proper client details and status

### 3. Verified Authentication
- Tested admin login API successfully
- Tested admin investments API successfully  
- Tested admin clients API successfully
- All admin authentication now working correctly
