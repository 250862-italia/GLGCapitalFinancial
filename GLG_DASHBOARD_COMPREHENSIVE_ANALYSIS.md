## ⚠️ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix

### 1. **BUILD FAILURE - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Issue**: Next.js build fails with "Event handlers cannot be passed to Client Component props" errors.

**Root Cause**: UI components missing `"use client"` directive:
- `components/ui/Badge.tsx`
- `components/ui/Card.tsx` 
- Several other component files

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Cannot deploy to production
- ❌ Build process times out after 60 seconds
- ❌ Static page generation fails

**Solution Required**:
```typescript
// Add to top of each UI component file
"use client";
```

### 2. **SECURITY VULNERABILITY - HIGH PRIORITY**
**Issue**: Database password exposed in `env.txt` file.

**Exposed Credentials**:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:Nncgnn1962* @db.dobjulfwktzltpvqtxbql.supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

**Immediate Actions Required**:
1. ✅ Move all secrets to `.env.local` (excluded from git)
2. ✅ Rotate database password
3. ✅ Update Supabase security settings
4. ✅ Remove `env.txt` from repository
