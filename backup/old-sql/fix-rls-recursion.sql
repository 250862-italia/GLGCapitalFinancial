-- GLG Capital Financial - Fix RLS Infinite Recursion
-- Script per risolvere il problema di infinite recursion nelle policy

-- =====================================================
-- 1. DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- Drop all policies from all tables
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all profiles" ON profiles;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own client data" ON clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own client data" ON clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own client data" ON clients;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all client data" ON clients;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view active packages" ON packages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage packages" ON packages;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own investments" ON investments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own investments" ON investments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all investments" ON investments;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own payments" ON payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all payments" ON payments;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage team members" ON team_members;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can view published content" ON content;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own informational requests" ON informational_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own informational requests" ON informational_requests;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all informational requests" ON informational_requests;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view analytics" ON analytics;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own notifications" ON notifications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own notifications" ON notifications;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage email queue" ON email_queue;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. DISABLE RLS TEMPORARILY
-- =====================================================

ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE clients DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE packages DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE investments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE payments DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE team_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE partnerships DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE content DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE kyc_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE informational_requests DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE analytics DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE email_queue DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- =====================================================
-- 3. CREATE SIMPLE POLICIES WITHOUT RECURSION
-- =====================================================

-- Enable RLS on all tables
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE clients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE packages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE investments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE payments ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE team_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE partnerships ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE content ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE kyc_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE informational_requests ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE analytics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE notifications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE email_queue ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- =====================================================

-- 5. VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

-- Check RLS status

-- Test basic operations
SELECT 'Testing profiles table...' as test;
SELECT COUNT(*) as profiles_count FROM profiles;
